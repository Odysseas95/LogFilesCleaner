# Log Files Cleaner

The Log Files Cleaner is a service that helps you clean up log files based on their last write time. It recursively searches through a specified directory and deletes log files that are older than a certain number of days.

## Getting Started

To use the Log Files Cleaner, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

- [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) - Make sure you have .NET Framework installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/log-files-cleaner.git

2. Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

3. Build the project to resolve any dependencies and compile the code.

### Configuration

Modify the desired settings in the `app.config` file:

- `RootDir`: Specify the root directory to search for log files.
- `DaysBack`: Set the number of days back to keep log files. Files older than this number will be deleted.
- `IntervalMins`: Set the interval in minutes at which the service checks and deletes log files.
- `LogDir`: Specify the directory where the log files for the cleaner will be stored.

### Usage

1. Run the project, and the Log Files Cleaner service will start.

2. The cleaner will periodically check the specified directory and delete log files that exceed the specified number of days.

3. The service will log its activities in the log files stored in the `LogDir`.

### Log Files

The log files generated by the cleaner provide information about the cleaning process. They are named in the format `LogFilesCleaner_DD-MM-YYYY_N.log`, where `N` represents the file number.
